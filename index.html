        <h1>My Bio</h1>
        <p>
            My name is Kenneth ndubueze, the second child born to Mr. and Mrs. Bartholomew Nwagwu. <br> <br>
            Growing up amidst the vibrant energy of a family with six children, I discovered my fascination with the intricate 
            world of computer science and coding at a young age. <br> <br>
            This early spark ignited a journey of continuous learning and exploration that continues to this day.  <br> <br>

            From the outset, I demonstrated an innate curiosity for how computers work and the magic 
            behind lines of code. <br> <br>
            This curiosity propelled me to actively seek opportunities to deepen my understanding. <br> <br>
            I embarked on a self-directed learning path, leveraging various online platforms to hone my skills. <br> <br>
            My educational journey has taken me through engaging programs at CodeKamp, Side Hustle, and currently, Alt School, each providing unique 
            perspectives and valuable tools for my growing skillset.  <br> <br> <br> <br>

            I understands that the field of computer science is a dynamic and ever-evolving landscape. <br> <br>
            I embraces the continuous learning process, recognizing that there's always something new to discover and master. <br> <br>
            I approaches each new challenge with enthusiasm, eager to expand my knowledge and refine my abilities. <br> <br>
            I view coding not just as a technical skill, but as a powerful tool for creativity and problem-solving. <br>

            While still in the exciting phase of acquiring new skills and knowledge, I possesses a strong foundation and a clear vision 
            for my future. <br> <br>
            I am driven by a genuine love for the craft and a desire to make a meaningful impact in the digital world. <br> <br>
            I believe I am a rising star in the world of computer science, with a bright future ahead. <br><br> <br>
